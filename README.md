# Diamond Quality Prediction Tool

## Introduction
The Diamond Quality Prediction Tool is an innovative application built to provide accurate predictions of diamond quality based on various input characteristics. It leverages state-of-the-art algorithms and industry knowledge to offer reliable assessments. Built on Django, the platform uses Django Rest Framework for the backend API and Django's templating system for the frontend, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Dataset
The dataset underpinning the tool comprises records of diamonds with distinct characteristics, including:

- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Clarity**: Measurement of how clear the diamond is (e.g., IF, VVS1, VS1, SI1, I1).
- **Cut**: Quality of the diamond's cut (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent).
- **Color**: Grade of diamond color (e.g., J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A).
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage, calculated as \( z / \text{mean}(x, y) \) â€“ where \( z \) is the depth of the diamond and \( x \) and \( y \) are the length and width.
- **Table**: Width of the diamond's table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter.

Each record in the dataset also includes a `Quality` label, which is the target variable the tool predicts.

## Features

### Backend (Django Rest Framework API)
- **Data Endpoint**: Allows for retrieval and submission of diamond data records.
- **Prediction Endpoint**: Accepts diamond characteristics as input and returns a predicted quality.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle a large number of requests efficiently.
- **Security**: Proper authentication and data validation mechanisms are in place.

### Frontend (Django App)
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive design that guides users through the diamond quality prediction process.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the tool is accessible on various devices, from desktops to mobiles.
- **Interactive Form**: Users can input diamond characteristics and instantly receive quality predictions.
- **Informational Content**: Provides users with insights into diamond characteristics and their significance.

### Overall Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Considers a wide range of diamond characteristics for a holistic evaluation.
- **Accuracy**: Uses a state-of-the-art machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset to ensure reliable predictions.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django Rest Framework is utilized for creating a robust and scalable API.
- **Frontend**: Django's templating system, combined with modern HTML and CSS, provides a rich user interface.
- **Database**: The default Django database (SQLite) stores the diamond data, but can easily be swapped with more scalable options like PostgreSQL for larger deployments.
- **Deployment**: The platform is designed for easy deployment on cloud platforms like AWS

## Conclusion
The Diamond Quality Prediction Tool is a comprehensive platform designed for both diamond enthusiasts and professionals. It bridges the gap between traditional gemology and modern data analytics, offering a reliable method to assess diamond quality.
